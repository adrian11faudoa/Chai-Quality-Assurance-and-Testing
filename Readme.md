# Quality Assurance with Chai

This is the boilerplate for the Quality Assurance with Chai lessons. Instructions for completing these lessons start at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/quality-assurance-and-testing-with-chai/



Chai is a JavaScript testing library that helps you confirm that your program still behaves the way you expect it to after you make changes to your code.

Using Chai, you can write tests that describe your program's requirements and see if your program meets them.

In this course, you'll learn about assertions, deep equality, truthiness, testing APIs, and other fundamentals for testing JavaScript applications.



Within tests/1_unit-tests.js under the test labeled #1 in the Basic Assertions suite, change each assert to either assert.isNull or assert.isNotNull to make the test pass (should evaluate to true). Do not alter the arguments passed to the asserts.

1. All tests should pass.

2. You should choose the correct method for the first assertion - isNull vs. isNotNull.

3. You should choose the correct method for the second assertion - isNull vs. isNotNull.
